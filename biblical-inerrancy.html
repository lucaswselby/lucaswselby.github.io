        <section id="Motivation">
            <h2>Motivation: What is the Bible?</h2>
            <p>I grew up believing that everything written in the Bible was literally true. I imagined God delivering His Word to authors, slowly revealing Himself throughout history via an autobiographical textbook/love letter of history, law, poetry, and prophecy. The Bible was the sole, infallible authority for my faith. Correctly interpreted, it alone could lead me to live a love-filled life and choose salvation.</p>
            <p>The particularities of my faith caused some social awkwardness in my adolescence. In middle school, I helped lead a Bible study group nominally focused on Christian apologetics, but which primarily featured my friends and I making fun of other religions. In high school biology, I got permission from my teacher to give an impassioned speech to my class about the flaws in evolutionary biology and how we should all be biblical literalists.</p>
            <p>I no longer see the Bible through this lens. I still read the Bible and find value in its teachings. I still consider myself a Christian. No monumental event changed my mind or caused me to “stray from the faith.” In this essay, I aim to guide a similar deconstruction of biblical inerrancy and provide an alternative view in which I have found freedom. To do this, I will first join the chorus of amateur scholars and attempt to find a contradiction in the Bible. Next, I will follow the inerrantist response to my alleged contradiction. This will motivate an exploration of the justification for biblical inerrancy, beginning with claims of a scriptural justification and leading to a historical investigation of the doctrine's origin. Having thoroughly examined historical and contemporary expressions of the doctrine, I will then provide an alternative proposition.</p>

        <section id="Inaccuracies">
            <h2>Potential Inaccuracies in the New Testament</h2>
            <p>First, I argue that the Bible contains contradictions. I recognize that I am not the first to make this claim. Apparently different side-by-side creation narratives in Genesis, histories in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, and genealogies listed in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, as well as many other alleged contradictions, have been debated by scholars of various beliefs for centuries. I would like to focus on one alleged contradiction to use as an example: the differing dates of Jesus' birth in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.</p>
            <p>Matthew 2:1 reads, "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king." Matthew's "Herod the king" is thought to be Herod the Great, the first of a dynasty of Herods who ruled in Judea, because the author later refers to "Herod the tetrarch" in Matthew 14:1. Because only Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great, bore the title of tetrarch, (<a href="#"></a>) the Gospel’s “Herod the king” was most likely Herod the Great. A corroborating argument can be made using Luke 1:5 and 3:1. Scholars estimate Herod the Great’s death in either 4 or 1 BCE, so the author of the Gospel of Matthew dated Jesus’ birth before 1 BCE.</p>
